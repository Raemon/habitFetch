'''
Rough outline of tests (can be done manually for now till I figure out testing)

for item in checklist_items:
	create habitRPG todo
		create checklist (a, b, c)
		for checklist_item in checklist:
		






POTENTIAL PROBLEMS	
	Problems with HabitRPG:
		- sometimes an item has no history
		- sometimes an item's id doesn't follow the id format (I once saw an id that was the same as the name)


	Problems with HabitFetch
		- if an item has history, make sure that history is used instead of creating one based off "today"
